# YouClipAI

## Abstract
The rapid growth of online video content has significantly transformed how people
access information. Platforms like YouTube host an extensive range of videos
across diverse categories, offering users a wealth of resources. However, while
this vast collection is undeniably valuable, it presents notable challenges. Locating
specific information within a video can be a tedious and time-consuming task, as
the platform’s search functionality largely depends on metadata such as titles, tags,
and descriptions. Consequently, users often find themselves manually navigating
through lengthy videos to pinpoint the exact moments of interest. This inefficiency
has highlighted the need for a smarter solution—one that understands the content
within a video rather than relying solely on descriptive metadata. To address
this issue, we introduce YouClipAI, a platform that integrates video search with
Large Language Models (LLMs), offering a precise, content-driven method for
identifying and extracting specific video clips that best match the user’s query.
